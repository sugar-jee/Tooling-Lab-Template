## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 9. 
I do not pass one of the npm tests. This is because the files in my array don't match the expected files. However, when I followed the instructions it downloaded files weith different naming conventions, some of which can't be changed without spurring errors, such as eslint.config.mjs. Others I explicitly added because the instructions said to, such as webpack.config.js.
I am also not sure if I completed pt5 E2E testing correctly. It was confusing.

## Self-Reflection:
I think I did well on this assignment. But I had a lot of confusing moments. This assignment diverged from the written instructions a significant amount and should be updated. It made it very confusing at times since file names didn't match up and I had to do some guess work & googling.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About two hours.
